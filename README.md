### Project Overview

Welcome to our GitHub repository! This project, undertaken during our last semester, was a collaborative effort between myself and my teammate, Harmandeep. Our goal was to build a robust web application leveraging MongoDB, Express JS, and various modules to handle encryption, session management, and more.

### Features

-   Data Collection: We scraped data on all restaurants in New York City, capturing details such as addresses, boroughs, and cuisine types.

-   Sorting and Display: Using handlebar templates, we organized the gathered data into a sorted list for easy access and navigation.

### Technologies Used

-   MongoDB
-   Express JS
-   Handlebars
-   Various npm modules for encryption, session management, etc.

### Learning Experience

This project provided us with invaluable insights into web development practices, problem-solving skills, and collaboration. We encountered challenges that pushed our boundaries and deepened our understanding of the technologies involved.
